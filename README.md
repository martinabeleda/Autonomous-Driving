## Intro to Git

0. Download the terminal

	Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

	Run a terminal (eg. iterm for Mac or git bash for Windows) after Git is installed and then continue

1. Navigate

	Navigate to the directory on your computer that you want to store a copy of the repository on

	If you're using a terminal, navigate to the directory by using:

	```
	cd <directory>
	```

	You can use `ls` to show the contents of the current directory

2. Initialise Git

	Initialise an empty Git repo with the command:

	```
	git init
	```

3. Cloning

	Cloning is making a local copy of the Git repo

	You can make changes to this copy and they remain "local" until they are "pushed/synced" to the remote repository (pushed using git bash terminal or synced using the git gui)

	In order to clone you need the URL of the main repo (given below)

	Clone the repo with the command:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/jpwebb/FLORA-KFP.git
	```

	If you get any errors at this stage it means you haven't been added as a collaborator to the repo yet - send Jason your Github account name and he will add you to the repo as a collaborator

4. Go into the local repo (the clone you just made)

	Enter the following command:

	```
	cd FLORA-KFP
	```

5. Branching

	Go to [Atlassian's Git Branches Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/) and checkout their tutorial on how to branch before you continue (for your own benefit)

	A branch is an independent line of development; we will use them to test and write our modules in parallel before merging them back into the master

	To list all of the branches in the repo, enter:

	```
	git branch
	```

	We'll use a naming convention to ensure we know who created the branch

	Try and keep the branch name clear and simple so we know what it's for without it being a novel

	Eg. "martin/rf" is the branch Marty has created to work on the RF module

	To create a new branch called <branch name>, enter:	

	```
	git branch <branch name>
	```

	At any point in time you can check which branch you're currently on with the command:

	```
	git status
	```

	This will also tell you if there's anything waiting to be committed (more on that later)

	At this stage, even though you have created a new branch you're still on the 'master' branch

	To navigate to your newly created branch (or any other branch), enter:

	```
	git checkout <branch name>
	```

	Notice your local repo (the clone) will change to show what is in your current branch

	Your branch will initialise to the state of the master at the time the branch was created

	Now you can work on your branch


6. Committing changes

	Committing a change is the act of locking it in at a local level

	This is a two-step process; staging and committing

	To stage all your changes, enter:

	```
	git add *
	```

	To commit these changes, enter:

	```
	git commit -m "<your name>: <A brief message about the changes>"
	```

	At the moment these changes are only local

7. Syncing local and remote repos

	The changes you have made so far are only local to your machine

	In order to update the online repo we have to "push" these changes

	(the term 'push' may sometimes be replaced with 'sync' but they mean the same thing - the terminal uses the command `push` whereas the git gui uses a clickable `sync` option)

	To push your changes to the online repo using the terminal, enter:

	```
	git push origin <branch name>
	```

	It is important to include the correct branch name here to ensure your changes don't overwrite a different branch

8. Check the online repo

	Log into [Github](http://www.github.com) and navigate to the repo

	Select your branch from just above and to the left of the file list

	The files should be updated to reflect any changes you have made and the message you wrote in Step 6 is displayed next to any updated files, as well as the time of the most recent commit for each updated file/folder
