# PiCar
Experimental robotics major project - multi-robot autonomous car network

## Cloning

```
git clone https://github.com/martinabeleda/PiCar.git
```

## PiCar setup

The Pi is configured to startup in Command Line Interface (CLI) mode and automatically logged in as pi. This saves memory and startup time because the front end GUI doesn't have to load. To manually start the desktop GUI, type `startx` into CLI.

The password for the default user has been set to `picar`.

First, I set up hotspot on my phone and connect both the Pi and my laptop to it. SSH instructions:

Marty's pi:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh pi@192.168.43.94
pi@192.168.43.94's password: picar
```

Tom's Pi:
```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh pi@192.168.43.118
pi@192.168.43.118's password: picar
```
